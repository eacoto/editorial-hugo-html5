# Genetics

## Introduction
Genetics is the study of heredity and the variation of inherited characteristics. It explains how traits are passed from parents to offspring and involves the study of genes, genetic variation, and the molecular mechanisms of gene function.

## DNA Structure
- Double helix
- Composed of nucleotides (Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, Guanine)

## Genetic Inheritance
### Mendelian Genetics
- Gregor Mendel's principles
- Law of Segregation
- Law of Independent Assortment

### Non-Mendelian Genetics
- Incomplete dominance
- Codominance
- Polygenic inheritance

## Genetic Mutations
- Point mutations
- Insertions and deletions
- Chromosomal alterations

## Modern Genetics
### Genetic Engineering
- CRISPR-Cas9
- Gene therapy

### Genomics
- Study of whole genomes
- Human Genome Project

## Conclusion
Genetics is fundamental to understanding biological diversity, evolution, and the mechanisms of many diseases, paving the way for innovative treatments and biotechnological advancements.

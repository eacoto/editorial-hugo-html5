## Introduction
Evolution is the process by which different kinds of living organisms have developed and diversified from earlier forms during the history of the Earth. It is a central concept in biology, explaining the diversity of life.

## Theories of Evolution
### Charles Darwin
- Natural selection
- Survival of the fittest
- "On the Origin of Species"

### Modern Synthesis
- Integration of Darwinian evolution with Mendelian genetics

## Mechanisms of Evolution
### Natural Selection
- Differential survival and reproduction

### Genetic Drift
- Random changes in allele frequencies

### Gene Flow
- Movement of genes between populations

### Mutation
- Source of genetic variation

## Evidence for Evolution
### Fossil Record
- Transitional fossils
- Dating methods

### Comparative Anatomy
- Homologous structures
- Analogous structures

### Molecular Biology
- DNA similarities
- Protein comparisons

## Speciation
- Formation of new species
- Allopatric and sympatric speciation

## Conclusion
Evolution provides a scientific explanation for the unity and diversity of life, supported by extensive evidence from multiple scientific disciplines.

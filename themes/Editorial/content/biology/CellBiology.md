## Introduction
Cell biology is the study of the structure, function, and behavior of cells. It encompasses both the microscopic and molecular levels and includes various sub-disciplines such as biochemistry, molecular biology, and genetics.

## Cell Theory
1. All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
2. The cell is the basic unit of life.
3. All cells arise from pre-existing cells.

## Types of Cells
### Prokaryotic Cells
- No nucleus
- Smaller and simpler structure
- Examples: Bacteria and Archaea

### Eukaryotic Cells
- Contain a nucleus
- Larger and more complex
- Examples: Plants, Animals, Fungi, and Protists

## Cell Structure
### Plasma Membrane
- Phospholipid bilayer
- Selectively permeable

### Nucleus
- Contains DNA
- Site of transcription

### Mitochondria
- Powerhouse of the cell
- Site of ATP production

### Ribosomes
- Protein synthesis

### Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
- Rough ER: Studded with ribosomes, synthesizes proteins
- Smooth ER: Synthesizes lipids

### Golgi Apparatus
- Modifies, sorts, and packages proteins

## Cell Division
### Mitosis
- Division of somatic cells
- Results in two identical daughter cells

### Meiosis
- Division of germ cells
- Results in four non-identical daughter cells

## Conclusion
Understanding cell biology is crucial for advancements in medicine, biotechnology, and understanding life itself.
